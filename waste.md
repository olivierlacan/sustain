# Waste

It's easy to think of trash as one amorphous blob of things to be discarded but even 
without turning into a forager you can start thinking about your waste differently.

## Food Scraps

Anything that comes from your plate (fruit peels, egg shells, chunks of fat, etc.) 
does not have to be sent to a landfill. It can be turned into compost which will 
be useful for growing pretty much anything.

You can learn how to do home composting (even when you live in a small appartment)
if your local government doesn't offer a compost collection service. But you can 
also use your voice as a citizen to push your local government to start collecting 
compost alongside regular trash and recycling. 

## Recycling

Talk about a complicated subject. It's almost disingenuous to group everything we 
try to recycle together. Plastics and papers obviously come to mind but they clearly 
have a very different recycling process. What about soiled papers and plastics? 
Should you recycle those anyway by assuming they are washed prior to recycling or 
should you wash them yourself?

It depends on your local recycling policy of course.
